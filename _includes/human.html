      </div>
      <p>Football is my first love.</p>
      <p>I speak Spanish and Italian.</p>
      <p>I tend to listen more than I speak.</p>
      <p>I’m not adventurous with food.</p>
      <p>I love a good Peroni.</p>
      <p class="u-spacing-4x">I wish Australia had a space program.</p>
      <p>My professional history used to sit here but I think knowing who you are working with is more important… besides there is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ra%C3%BAl-felix-carrizo-70716439/" target="_blank">linkedIn</a>.</p>

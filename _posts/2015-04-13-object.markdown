Connected Experience is a product which integrates a number of technologies including the Microsoft Surface multi-touch screen (Samsung SUR40) as well as Windows, Android and iPhone mobile devices. As an Android developer I built the native experience which would communicate with the Microsoft Surface table to download and manage various typesâ€™ of media.

I was responsible for all aspects of Android development including the build process, development, testing and publication. The Android app works across a number of Android API levels spanning from version 2.2 up to the latest Jelly Bean 4.* versions. It also runs a various device sizes.

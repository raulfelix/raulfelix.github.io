Consulting for Microsoft on a government project my role was to transform the look and feel of a Sharepoint system.

Work included creating custom master and page layouts, developing CSS rules to override the myriad of Sharepoint styles for MySites and Portals as well as implementing additional JavaScript where required. The target browsers included IE7, IE8 and IE9. Functional parity was achieved in all areas.

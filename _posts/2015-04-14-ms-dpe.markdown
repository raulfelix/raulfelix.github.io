The Microsoft Development Platform Evangelists (DPE) Portal is an intranet site allowing members to share snippets of innovative material sourced from the internet amongst members of Microsoft Australia.

The content was to be presented in an engaging manner to supplement the innovative nature of the material. This was a single page application driven by Javascript. I consulted and managed all front end development integrating the use of AJAX, JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. The end result was a dynamic user interface demonstrating the power of the latest scripting and CSS techniques.

          <p>Working alongside specialist architects, build a design language and architect “themeable” apps to move assets into a new age of device agnostic environments as well as creating greater alliance between channels. This was a technology driven project the details of which are sensitive.</p>

<p>As a front end developer I was brought on for my knowledge of JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and Android. I took ownership of implementing the theming taxonomy and design patterns of the API. I often lead small groups of developers, sharing knowledge of best practices throughout these teams in the bank and working very closely with the UX lead.</p>

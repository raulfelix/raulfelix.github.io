    <p>Primary task was to re-architect the user interface for a number of in house applications and documents. This involved wireframing, web design and software development. User research and usability testing was undertaken to validate proposed changes.</p>

<p>I redefined the front end technology stack and put in place a system to rapidly build UI components. The refactor always ensured legacy clients were well supported down to IE8. I managed a team of 1 front end and 6 backend developers, sharing knowledge and ensuring a high standard of code was maintained through code reviews and testing.</p>

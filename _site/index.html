<p><img src="/assets/images/hay-bales.jpg" alt="Bales of hay" /></p>

<p>We have all, at some point, loaded one fat ass <code>app.js</code> file containing all the javascript required for the application to run. But we can do better than that and with a tool like Webpack there is really no excuse why you cannot split up your code and asynchronously serve up what is needed, when it is needed.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it?</h2>

<p>I like to set this up based on my routes since this usually helps define the modules in the application. As an example, when a route is triggered, return an app bale.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="err">showAdminScreen()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="err">return</span> <span class="err">require.ensure([&#39;./AdminScreen.js&#39;],</span> <span class="err">(require)</span> <span class="err">=&gt;</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="err">//</span> <span class="err">do</span> <span class="err">something</span> <span class="err">here</span>
  <span class="p">}</span><span class="err">);</span>
<span class="err">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>It is as simple as that. Webpack will traverse the project source code creating a separate bale of javascript for each ensure statement it finds.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reduced load time due to smaller bales of code</li>
  <li>Tacking on new features to the app won’t grow other bales unecessarily</li>
  <li>When combined with caching only new bales will be downloaded removing the need to invalidate the entire cache</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps this is because of how simple it is to get started with node modules needing only a short command such as <code>npm install react --save</code> to get you started.</p>

<p>It kinda makes you feel…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/babel-image1.jpg" alt="A baby boss" /></p>

<p>Usually however, libraries change and they can do so very quickly. We are all busy people and often can fail to keep up with the changes which can include new features, more dependencies or breaking changes.</p>

<h2 id="lets-do-things-better">Lets do things better</h2>

<p>By default you get this in your package.json which says “give me all major 
updates and patches - i’m cool with that”. This might mean upgrading to
version 0.16.3 which could be a good or bad thing.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;react&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;^0.15.1&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To avoid that sort of trouble take back control of what happens when you 
install packages and use this which says “give me any patch for react but 
don’t upgrade the version”.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;react&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0.15.*&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is a much better approach where you are in full control of what changes and when.</p>

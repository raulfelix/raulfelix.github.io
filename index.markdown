#### Software Engineer specialising in front end architecture and user experience. My core disciplines include web and mobile application development, responsive design and rapid prototyping.

##### I enjoy technical challenges and piecing together technologies that create good web experiences. I write a lot of native HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as using frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone. I also build native mobile apps primarily targeted at the Android platform.

Right now... 

Working for the **Commonwealth Bank** exploring the future of customer and staff engagement models through rapid prototyping and design thinking. I am also exploring technology stacks and workflow patterns.

I recently collaborated on and built [lifewithoutandy.com](http://lifewithoutandy.com) - a customised Wordpress site with a global fan base.

#### As a Software Engineer I specialise in front end architecture and development. My primary focus is on web and mobile application development, responsive design and rapid prototyping. I enjoy technical challenges and interesting work. 

#### I write a lot of native *HTML*, *CSS* and *Javascript* and have plenty experience with frameworks like *AngularJS* and *Backbone* as well as the very excellent *ReactJS* library. I also build native and hybrid mobile apps.

Currently... 

Working for the **Commonwealth Bank** using ReactJS and the latest in Javascript to build fast and engaging web applications.

I collaborated on and built [lifewithoutandy.com](http://lifewithoutandy.com) - a customised Wordpress site with a global fan base.
